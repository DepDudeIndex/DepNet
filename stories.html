			<p><b><span class="firstletter">O</span>verwhelmed with excitement</b>, I left work in hurry and knew exactly what the rest of my night looked like. I had overheard my office crush in the elevator talk about how she’s been binge watching the new show “Pocketbook Struggles.” I would go home, make a bowl of Wheaties, try out the new strawberry Hershey's Syrup I got and stream the first few episodes, so I could bring it up in front of her tomorrow.</p>

			<p>I set my plans in motion straight away, tapping out a text to my friend Charlie. 

			<p><i>~hey. did u change ur netflix password? i couldnt log in yesterday~</i></p> 

			<p>I've been using Charlie's account for about a year, but had been unable to access it lately. Strange.</p> 

			<input type="button" onclick="return toggleMe('special1')" value="..."><br>
			<div id="special1" style="display:none"><p>I also sent myself a reminder email: "Draino." For two days, my tub has held four inches of stubborn, murky water that just won't drain. Before beginning my "Pocketbook Struggles" research, I could scoop out the standing water, flush it down the toilet, and apply the drain cleaner. My Thursday evening was shaping up to be pretty productive.</p> 

			<p>Outside my building was a homeless man who I pass on a semi-regular basis. I typically avoid eye contact by faking a text but today I was feeling especially chipper and dropped a dollar in his hat. I tried my best to discretely record it on snapchat to showcase my philanthropic side, but the sleeve of my shirt wound up obstructing the lens.</p>

			<p>Before cracking open the draino and tackling the tub, I whipped up a bowl of Wheaties so it could sit and become soggy while I worked away - I love soggy cereal! I took a picture of the bowl to share on Instagram but withheld from posting after realizing the bowl was stained and cracked. Not worth risking having the office crush see it and think I live like the man outside my building! Instead, I took a selfie of me with the Draino and my tub and captioned it "Draino my tub, feasto on Wheaties and watcho Pocketbook Struggles. #tubstruggles #thursdaynight" This post is very dissimilar to the rest of my account, but, admittedly, my hope was she might see it and throw it a like or, God willing, a comment.</p>

			<p>By the time I stretched supine on my couch, a soggy bowl of Wheaties perched precariously on my stomach, it was 8:42 p.m. My eyelids were heavy. "Pocketbook Struggles" was queued up on my 9" flatscreen, the theme music looping over the play menu. <i>Maybe I'll shut my eyes for a moment</i>, I though. <i>Get refreshed for my marathon viewing.</i></p>

			<p><i>Bah-dah-bum.</i> Theme music drifted throughout the room.</p>

			<p>A moment passed, then hours. I awoke, my heart thumping apace. <i>Bah-dah-bum</i>, the play menu hummed. Sunlight peeked through plastic blinds. Dried Wheaties stuck to my stomach and the small of my back. I reached for my phone; I mashed the home button. Black screen — dead battery. I squinted at the microwave clock in the gallery kitchen. 10:01 a.m. Late for work.</p></div>

			<p><b><span class="firstletter">S</span>o many things</b> conspired against him.</p>

			<p>Against his better instincts, he'd accelerated past the last exit, now many dozens of miles behind him. The next one was unknown. The gas needle sunk lower yet. Now, impossibly, it seemed beneath the "empty" text.</p>

			<p>Then there was the fire in his bowels. Hot, raging, desperately seeking a way out. It took everything to keep it inside. Sweat caked his thighs, his lower back, his armpits. The road ahead was black, the horizon shimmering in the heat.</p>

			<input type="button" onclick="return toggleMe('special2')" value="..."><br>
			<div id="special2" style="display:none"><p>"Not one country station," Melissa groused, fiddling with the radio knob. Static crackled, punctuated by the occasional, faint guitar lick, or a preacher's monotone. Jesus, he thought, berating himself. If I could turn back time. If only I'd decided to do something other than a picnic for our second date.</p>

			<p>While his focus bounced between the exit signs and keeping his sweat and bowels contained, Melissa gave up on the radio. She left it on a station with a preacher discussing life decisions. How fitting. Melissa fumbled her phone as it rang but eventually got hold in time to answer the FaceTime from Jake, one of her long time guy friends who seems to come up in every conversation. <i>Wow, Jake's calling, what a shocker</i>, he sarcastically thought, as he undoubtedly knew the guy had feelings for her.</p>
 
			<p>Because of poor reception, Melissa spoke in a raised voice - "I'M IN THE CAR WITH ROB COMING BACK FROM OUR PICNIC!"</p>
 
			<p>Jake quipped back "Ahh nothing like sharing your food with ants and mosquitos. Call me later."</p>
 
			<p>Jake's nasally voice was replaced by the preacher on the radio. "When making life decisions, it's an absolute necessity to look three steps ahead to ensure your next move will derive supreme happiness without flaw."</p>
 
			<p>His knuckles turned white as his grip on the steering wheel tightened, imagining the wheel as the neck of the preacher and Jake.</p>

			<p>His anxiety was transforming into fury — at himself, at the preacher, at Melissa. At Jake. His mind raced through all the decisions he could have made to avoid this. No picnic. Filling up on gas yesterday. And so on. And so on.</p>

			<p>Then the inevitable happened.</p>

			<p><i>Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk.</i></p>

			<p>The car bucked and slowed. The gas pedal lost all tension. The car rolled — hobbled — into the shoulder.</p>

			<p>"What's up?" Melissa asked, voice thick with worry.</p> 

			<p>He couldn't answer. Wouldn't. An empty has tank seemed trivial now. Something far worse was happening. He had lost control of his bowels.</p>

			<p>"Don't — just — waitasec," he sputtered lamely, opening the door and rolling out, hands clutching his stomach. For a split second, relief, as the pressure gave way. Then hot, wet shame. Then the smell.</p>

			<p>"OH MY GAWD," Melissa yelped, covering her mouth in disgust.</p> 

			<p>“OH MY G…” only this time the words of Melissa’s yelp turned into the cheese, crackers and salami she had for lunch. The, once upon a time, very neatly packed, kept and consumed picnic ingredients now lay across the car cockpit and passenger seat upholstery.</p>
 
			<p>The radio’s audio was affected causing a distorted, robotic sounding repetition of the preacher’s words “life decisions” several times before sputtering to silence.</p>
 
			<p>Humiliated and riddled with shame, he peered through the backseat window to try and gauge the situation. Delusion and panic dominated his thoughts.  Do I run? Act dead? Should I claim to have crohn’s? This was her fault. You fucking idiot. Just do SOMETHING!</p>
 
			<p>Melissa beat him to it – she leaped out of the passenger seat and onto the shoulder of the road and cried out “Rob what the hell! I can’t… I mean, I don’t even know what to…” she sighed “...look, I just ordered an uber for myself. You should probably do the same.”</p>
 
			<p>He knew there was nothing to say. This was the last he would see and hear from Melissa.</p> 

			<p>He was suddenly and pleasantly blindsided by a wave of apathy, as he wrapped his lower half in the picnic blanket.</p>
 
			<p>And with a slight grin on his face he thought: <i>I was due for a new pack of underwear anyway.</i></p></div>

			<p><b><span class="firstletter">I</span> was nearly</b> finished with my slide deck for an upcoming product pitch when my hourly "bathroom & water" reminder popped up. I happily closed it, stood up while making an unnecessary moan and headed for the restroom.</p>

			<p>I passed two coworkers from the accounting department along the way. Luckily our relationship didn't mandate any interaction.</p>

			<p>"I'm only 4 months along and I can already feel her kicking in there!" one of the women exclaimed. The other chuckled and responded "Congrats again! Where was she conceived?!"</p>

			<p><i>What a weird fucking question to ask,</i> I thought.</p>

			<input type="button" onclick="return toggleMe('special3')" value="..."><br>
			<div id="special3" style="display:none"><p>I was in the middle of washing my hands when I heard a thunderous scream come from the hall. It was followed by heavy footsteps. Then the door flung open.</p> 

			<p>It was Eric from the IT team. He stood there with a pale, blank look on his face. Frozen in place he said "I....won't....be at your....product pitch....later" before collapsing to the ground.</p>

			<p><i>Holy fucking shit: Eric had an axe lodged in his back!</i></p>

			<p>Eric collapsed to reveal Charlie, the short-tempered salesman who'd been let go last month.</p> 

			<p>"Fuckers!" Charlie screamed. His body was shaking. Veins exploded in every limb, every muscle. The blood vessels in his eyes had erupted, turning the white into a terrifying red.</p> 

			<p>Charlie took two steps forward and ripped the axe from Eric's limp body. A geyser of blood sprayed from the wound, drenching a cubicle across from the bathroom door.</p>

			 <p>"Who's next?!" Charlie bellowed, kicking over that same cubicle. The cheap partition collapsed to reveal Ron, a staff accountant. "No," said Ron feebly, on his knees and shielding his face with his forearms.</p> 

			<p>"Looks like we're in the red, Ronny!" Charlie laughed, raising his arm and axe into the air, preparing for another brutal swipe.</p> 

			<p>Charging down the hall was Pierpont, a colleague from the Paris office who was in town for a temporary project.</p>

			<p>Scissors in hand, raised beside his head, he hurled himself at Charlie and howled "zis is ze revolution!!"</p>

			<p>After only barely grazing Charlie's ear, Pierpont lie on the ground clutching his knee. His face exhibiting excruciating pain.</p>

			<p>In one fluid motion, Charlie realigned his aim from Ron to Pierpont, swung his arms downward, and with a single clean slice, split him in half.</p>

			<p>The office was in mass hysteria.</p>

			<p>"Oh my god!"</p>

			<p>"Quick, there's an exit in the back!"</p>

			<p>"Charlie, we used to get lunch together, please!"</p>

			<p>But the surrounding noise and mayhem became blurred when Charlie fully turned away from me. Charlie has an arm growing out of his back.</p>

			<p>For a moment, the carnage around me faded out. It was like the gruesome scene was unfolding on a TV set in another room.</p> 

			<p>A third arm? What? Did I... did I doze off at my desk?</p> 

			<p>And then I was back — back in the office, amid screams and sobs and moans. There was Pierpont, now just a torso and two arms and a head, pulling himself toward the stairwell.</p>

			<p>"What do y'all think of the new, improved Charlie?" screamed Charlie. He barked out a hoarse laugh. "Anyone need an extra hand?"</p>

			<p>The freak appendage flexed, then waved menacingly. Charlie barreled through a row of cubicles, sending the cheap dividers crashing to the floor. One of the partitions revealed Bradley, our 19-year-old intern. Charlie's third arm extended; his third hand wrapped around Bradley's neck. He lifted the teen off the ground and tossed him like a rag. He landed atop Pierpont's severed legs with a loud crunch.</p>

			<p>Now Charlie was striding toward Michelle's office. Michelle, the boss. Michelle, who'd fired Charlie three weeks ago.</p>

			<p>Without hesitation, Charlie kicked open Michelle’s door and stepped inside. Her window was open and the office was empty – she was making a getaway to her car in the parking lot. His three arms formed fists and slammed on the desk. “MICHELLEEE!!” He stood there for a moment, breathing heavily and looking up at the ceiling.</p>

			<p>There was just enough time for Damian, the VP of Human Resources, to sneak up behind him and slice off the hand of his 3rdarm. “Die you fucking gargoyle!!” It took him two hacks to fully sever the hand as the knife was a cheap dull cake cutter, left over from a recent birthday celebration.</p>

			<p>Almost instantly, a new 3rd hand formed. Damian was frozen. Speechless. Charlie slowly turned, grabbed Damian by the hair and dragged him to Pierpont’s legs. He threw Damian against the wall, picked up Pierpont’s legs and forced them around Damian’s head. He was using the legs as a nutcracker! Damian’s head exploded into pieces.</p>

			<p>Charlie followed Pierpont’s blood trail down the stairwell. The trail ended at Pierpont’s body at the bottom of the stairs. He was moaning and mumbling incoherently in French. Charlie snatched up the torso and exited through the emergency doorway. The doorway that leads directly to the parking lot.</p>

			<p>I watched the scene in the parking lot unfold from the ceiling-to-floor window in Michelle's office. With a BANG audible through the thick glass panes, Charlie crashed out a doorway and onto the parking lot's shimmering pavement.</p> 

			<p>"FUCKKARARGGG!" he howled. He was staggering now, as if drunk; his skin was erupting into boils and blisters. Whatever preternatural science or dark magic had given him his third arm was now exacting a vicious toll.</p>

			<p>Still, Charlie persisted. He lurched toward Michelle's red convertible. Pierpont's lifeless torso was tucked between Charlie's left bicep and chest.</p> 

			<p>Inside the car, Michelle fumbled frantically with the keys. Her eyes were wide, wild.</p> 

			<p>An earsplitting sound! CRWWSSSHH. Metal ripping, bending, sparking: Charlie tore the driver's side door off the automobile as if it were thin paper. Michelle's mouth was a gaping black hole. She was screaming, she must have been — but it was deafened by the screeching metal.</p>

			<p>Charlie reached inside and pulled the woman out. She looked like a doll in his bulging arms; utterly helpless.</p> 

			<p>"ABOUT THAT SEVERANCE," Charlie bellowed, holding her high above his head. The boils were erupting on his face now, pus streaming into his eyes and nose and mouth. He was deteriorating rapidly — but had enough energy left to exact his revenge.</p>

			<p>And then! Pierpont — or what was left of him — was suddenly no longer lifeless. Not yet. The head and torso and arms sprang into motion. His hands clawed at Charlie's face, digging into the oozing flesh and tearing it off in sheets. "BLASASRGHGHGH!" Charlie screamed, gurgling as his very face and throat collapsed around his mouth.</p>

			<p>"Ze revolution!" Pierpont hollered triumphantly.</p> 

			<p>Michelle, now free from Charlie's grasp, climbed back into her car. With surprising precision, she maneuveredthe coup 90 degrees, backed up several dozen yards, and revved the engine. Then she sped forward, crashing through the convulsing pile of blood and guts that was Charlie and Pierpont. She accelerated onward, fishtailing out of the parking lot and into the street. It was finished.</p>

			<p>I jumped — a hand touched my shoulder. It was Ron, coated in blood.</p>

			<p>"Hey," he managed meekly. "Meeting in five."</p></div>
